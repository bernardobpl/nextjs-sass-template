## This is my public NextJS SASS Template
This template was created using ```yarn create next-app {name} --typescript```
I decided to create this template to get an project initial setup faster.
Don't feel afraid to open a bright white screen, i took care of it ðŸ‘Œ.


Using my template will save your time with those:
* Typescript
* Eslint
* Prettier
* Husky
* Lint-staged
* React-icons
* Sass
* Good and commum Global css styles
* Next Document
* Page files under "pages" directory
* Creating "src" folder
* Cleaning NextJS template


## Suggestions
I won't add more libraries and configs because it will enforce some personal choices that may be useless for some projects or not a personal preference to others.


But i recommend using:
* Radix UI combined with Sass to create custom components
* Framer Motion or GSAP if need to make animations
* Axios for requests
* React-query to cache requests and have a better performance
* NextAuth for authetication
* React Hook Form for managing your form data and submit
* Yup to validate form data
* Immer/user-immer if you're managing deep object data
* Zustand as state manager
* Nookies if need to use a browser storage


Now you're ready to code!
